In this excel document, the results for each participant are reported on different sheets (Sheet 1 = subject 1, Sheet 2 = subject 2, etc). All numbers are reported as Cochlear current level steps, which can be converted to dB re 1 microamp using the formula: dB re 1 microamp = 17.5*10^(CL step/255).
